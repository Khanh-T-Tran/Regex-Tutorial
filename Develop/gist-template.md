# Regex Tutorial

#### As a web developer, this tutorial was made in order to understand how Regular Expressions or Regex work to define a search pattern.

## Summary

#### A Regex or regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, which are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, also looks for input validation. This technique usualy developed in theoretical computer science.
#### Example of an Regex:
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

#### Follow the content below to understand each part of the example

## Regex Components

### Anchors
#### While the two forward slash characters "/" are used to denote the boundaries of a regular expression, the "^" and "$" are the two anchors that signal the begin and the end of that regex.

#### There are also other two anchors "\b"  and "\B":

    \b Matches a word boundary position between a word character and non-word character or position (start / end of string). See the word character class (w) for more info.

    \B Matches any position that is not a word boundary. This matches a position, not a character.
    See Boundaries for more detailed Information
